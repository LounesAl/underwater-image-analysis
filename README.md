# Underwater-image-analysis
Portal of numerical methods for the analysis of underwater temporal sequences

This project is a python application that includes the Detectron2 library and a graphical interface. The objective of this project is to extract the characteristics of some underwater species and to follow their evolution in time. This project aims to allow all users, even those who do not know programming, to use the interface.
